# TwigFoo: Functional Programming Snippets

Welcome to TwigFoo! This repository is a collection of functional programming snippets as I journey through understanding functional programming constructs in various languages: TypeScript, Go, Haskell, and Kotlin.

## What is TwigFoo?

TwigFoo is an educational package intended to encapsulate various functional programming constructs in multiple languages. It's like a cookbook, but for functional programming!

The primary aim of this project is to create a reference guide that can be utilized by those looking to understand and implement functional programming constructs in their work, studies, or personal projects.

## Languages Included

- TypeScript
- Go
- Haskell
- Kotlin

## Structure of the Repository

Each language has its own dedicated directory that contains various .ts, .go, .hs, or .kt files related to different functional programming topics. These directories are:

- /TypeScript
- /Go
- /Haskell
- /Kotlin

Inside each directory, you will find examples of different functional programming constructs and techniques commonly used in that particular language.

## How to Use TwigFoo

Feel free to browse through the directories and files. You may run the programs locally by cloning the repository and executing the files in your local development environment.

## Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but I'm open to collaborations and contributions. If you see a mistake, there's something you would like to add or if you have a functional programming concept you'd like to see, please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.

## License

TwigFoo is open-source and is licensed under the MIT License. For more details, see the `LICENSE` file in this repository.

## Disclaimer

This is a work-in-progress, so the collection of snippets will continue to grow as I learn more about functional programming. Also, the information provided here is based on my understanding of functional programming, so there may be more efficient ways to implement these constructs.
